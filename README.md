# Recipe Review Analysis: Topic Modeling & Keyword Extraction

## Project Goal
Analyze unstructured recipe reviews to extract quality metrics and satisfaction drivers that are not captured by star ratings.

## Data & Tech
* Data Source: Allrecipes.com (approximately 6,000 user reviews)
* Programming: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NLTK, Skearn-learn, Sentence_transformers, KeyBERT

## Methodolgy
* Keyword Extraction: Identification of key terms using KeyBERT and TF-IDF.
* Dimensionality Reduction: Noise reduction and visualization using PCA and UMAP.
* Topic Modeling: Classification of user feedback into latent topics using LDA.

## Key Finding
* Identification of specific feedback clusters, including ease of cooking and recipe reliability
* Visualization of review data to identify user sentiment and feedback patterns.
